## Accessibility Practices

This website is built with the following accessibility features in mind:

-   **Color Contrast**: A color scheme designed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards for contrast.
-   **Alternative Text**: Alternative text (alt text) for all informative images and figures to ensure they are understandable to users of screen readers.
-   **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts and a logical heading structure to aid navigation and comprehension, particularly for users with visual impairments or reading disabilities.
-   **Navigation**: A simple and consistent navigation structure across the site.
-   **Compatibility**: Use of semantic HTML to ensure compatibility with a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies.

## Continuous Improvement

As a research scientist, not a professional web developer, I am continuously learning how to implement better accessibility practices in the content I create.

My plan is to regularly audit this site for accessibility issues and learn how to remedy them as best I can. I will be using standard evaluation tools to guide this process:

-   [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)

I will document significant accessibility issues and any corrective actions in the [public GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/jameslehoux/website).
