::: {#hero-heading}

I'm a scientist and engineer focused on developing new ways to understand and improve energy storage materials.

As a **Faraday Institution Emerging Leader Fellow**, I lead battery research across the UK's National Facilities, including the [ISIS Neutron and Muon Source](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/), [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/), and the [Central Laser Facilities](https://www.clf.stfc.ac.uk/). My work sits at the intersection of hands-on experimental science and high-performance computational modeling.

Beyond the lab, I run an energy storage consultancy and lead the development of [**OpenImpala**](https://github.com/kramergroup/openImpala), an open-source simulation package.

Get in touch by [sending me a note](/contact.qmd)! {{< fa feather-pointed >}}

## About Me

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6 #about-me-1}

### My Research
My research is focused on method development for the physical characterisation of electrochemical devices. I specialise in combining *operando* experiments with advanced computational analysis to push the boundaries of what we can learn about batteries.

#### Experimental Techniques
Experimentally, I develop and apply techniques like coupled X-ray CT and diffraction, spectro-ptychography, and dark-field X-ray microscopy. I have successfully led 8 experiments as Principal Investigator and 14 as Co-Investigator at facilities in the UK and abroad.

#### Computational Methods
Computationally, I build high-throughput data analysis pipelines using deep learning architectures (e.g., U-Net) and develop novel approaches like [super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SR-GANs)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04605-9).

### Background & Education
I have a background in both industry and academia. Before my current fellowship, I was a **Beamline Scientist** at [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/), where I led technique development for scattering tomography. I began my career as a **Design Engineer** at [Xtrac Ltd.](https://www.xtrac.com/), leading a design project for a top-tier motorsport gearbox.
