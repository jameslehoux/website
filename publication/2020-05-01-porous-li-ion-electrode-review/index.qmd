## Abstract

Mathematical models have been used extensively to simulate physical and electrochemical processes occurring inside lithium-ion batteries. Physical based models, coupled with experimental validation, have revealed greater scientific understanding of the processes inside the battery. A region of specific interest is the porous electrode. However, the heterogeneous geometry of the porous structure presents practical difficulties in developing suitable models. The present paper is a review of the studies on the physical modelling of lithium ion porous electrodes. Here we review common methods to model the (de)intercalation behaviour of porous Li-ion battery electrodes. Advantages and drawbacks are contrasted to highlight some challenges that suggest directions and priorities for further research in the field.
