## Abstract

This work uses an open-source, data-driven, image-based modelling framework; OpenImpala. Lithium iron phosphate electrode samples were imaged using micro-computed tomography. Two scans were performed using the Zeiss 160 kVp Versa 510 at the University of Southampton. The two scans were both carried out on the same sample and using the same focal point, this is so they could be used as a direct comparison to see how porosity and effective tortuosity changed with spatial resolution. It is found that the Bruggeman correlation significantly underestimates the effective tortuosity compared to the OpenImpala calculated results. It is also found that there is a larger statistical variability in the 801 nm results, whereas the 400 nm results have a much smaller standard deviation. These results were compared to results obtained from focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy tomographic data of a single nickel manganese cobalt oxide porous active particle. The two sets of results were found to have the same trends.
