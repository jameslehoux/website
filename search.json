    "text": "The bacterial plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa causes disease in several globally important crops. However, some cultivars harbour reduced bacterial loads and express few symptoms. Evidence considering plant species in isolation suggests xylem structure influences cultivar susceptibility to X. fastidiosa. We test this theory more broadly by analysing high-resolution synchrotron X-ray computed tomography of healthy and infected plant vasculature from two taxonomic groups containing susceptible and resistant varieties: two citrus cultivars (sweet orange cv. Pera, tangor cv. Murcott) and two olive cultivars (Koroneiki, Leccino). Results found the susceptible plants had more vessels than resistant ones, which could promote within-host pathogen spread. However, features associated with resistance were not shared by citrus and olive. While xylem vessels in resistant citrus stems had comparable diameters to those in susceptible plants, resistant olives had narrower vessels that could limit biofilm spread. And while differences among olive cultivars were not detected, results suggest greater vascular connectivity in resistant compared to susceptible citrus plants. We hypothesize that this provides alternate flow paths for sustaining hydraulic functionality under infection. In summary, this work elucidates different physiological resistance mechanisms between two taxonomic groups, while supporting the existence of an intertaxonomical metric that could speed up the identification of candidate-resistant plants."

    "text": "Transport in porous media plays an essential role for many physical, engineering, biological and environmental processes. Novel synchrotron imaging techniques and image-based models have enabled more robust quantification of geometric structures that influence transport through the pore space. However, image-based modelling is computationally expensive, and end users often require, while conducting imaging campaign, fast and agile bulk-scale effective parameter estimates that account for the pore-scale details. In this manuscript we enhance a pre-existing image-based model solver known as OpenImpala to estimate bulk-scale effective transport parameters. In particular, the boundary conditions and equations in OpenImpala were modified in order to estimate the effective diffusivity in an imaged system/geometry via a formal multi-scale homogenisation expansion. Estimates of effective pore space diffusivity were generated for a range of elementary volume sizes to estimate when the effective diffusivity values begin to converge to a single value. Results from OpenImpala were validated against a commercial finite element method package COMSOL Multiphysics (abbreviated as COMSOL). Results showed that the effective diffusivity values determined with OpenImpala were similar to those estimated by COMSOL. Tests on larger domains comparing a full image-based model to a homogenised (geometrically uniform) domain that used the effective diffusivity parameters showed differences below 2% error, thus verifying the accuracy of the effective diffusivity estimates. Finally, we compared OpenImpala’s parallel computing speeds to COMSOL. OpenImpala consistently ran simulations within fractions of minutes, which was two orders of magnitude faster than COMSOL providing identical supercomputing specifications. In conclusion, we demonstrated OpenImpala’s utility as part of an on-site tomography processing pipeline allowing for fast and agile assessment of porous media processes and to guide imaging campaigns while they are happening at synchrotron beamlines."

Multi-resolution micro X-ray computed tomography was performed on a zinc-doped Zeolite 13X fragment to characterise its pores and features before spatially resolved X-ray diffraction computed tomography was carried out to characterise the topographical distribution of sodium and zinc phases. Zinc absorption was controlled to create a simple, spatially isolated, two-phase material. Both raw and processed data are available as a series of Zenodo entries. Altogether we present a spatially resolved, three-dimensional, multimodal, multi-resolution dataset that can be used to develop machine learning techniques.

Multi-resolution micro X-ray computed tomography was performed on a zinc-doped Zeolite 13X fragment to characterise its pores and features before spatially resolved X-ray diffraction computed tomography was carried out to characterise the topographical distribution of sodium and zinc phases. Zinc absorption was controlled to create a simple, spatially isolated, two-phase material. Both raw and processed data are available as a series of Zenodo entries. Altogether we present a spatially resolved, three-dimensional, multimodal, multi-resolution dataset that can be used to develop machine learning techniques. Such techniques include the development of super-resolution, multimodal data fusion, and 3D reconstruction algorithms."

    "text": "In recent years, x-ray tomography has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for the study of lithium ion batteries and the processes occurring within. A region of specific interest is the electrode and, in particular, the heterogeneous and porous structure. The present paper is a review of studies that use x-ray tomography to characterise electrode structure, at both the cell and microstructure scales. At the cell level, x-ray tomography is used to investigate macroscopic design parameters, such as anode and cathode thicknesses, packing density and alignment of assembled cells, as well as to visualise any macroscopic structural defects, such as islanding. At the microstructure level, x-ray tomography allows for quantitative analysis of electrode structures to ascertain parameters such as particle size, tortuosity and volume fraction. The paper also explores different techniques that have been used across the field, from ex-situ, in-situ and operando techniques, to multimodal imaging methods, tomography informed design and results informed imaging."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This work uses an open-source, data-driven, image-based modelling framework; OpenImpala. Lithium iron phosphate electrode samples were imaged using micro-computed tomography. Two scans were performed using the Zeiss 160 kVp Versa 510 at the University of Southampton. The two scans were both carried out on the same sample and using the same focal point, this is so they could be used as a direct comparison to see how porosity and effective tortuosity changed with spatial resolution. It is found that the Bruggeman correlation significantly underestimates the effective tortuosity compared to the OpenImpala calculated results. It is also found that there is a larger statistical variability in the 801 nm results, whereas the 400 nm results have a much smaller standard deviation. These results were compared to results obtained from focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy tomographic data of a single nickel manganese cobalt oxide porous active particle. The two sets of results were found to have the same trends."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lithium metal (LM) and zero-excess lithium (ZE) anodes offer pathways to increase the energy density of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). We employ operando X-ray computed tomography (XCT) combined with an image subtraction method (ISM) to investigate failure mechanisms in asymmetric Li6PS5Cl (LPSC)-based ASSBs, using lithium counter electrode (CE) and copper (Cu) working electrode (WE) to emulate LM and ZE configurations. ISM enables real-time visualization of lithium plating/stripping morphology, stack structure evolution, and lithium reversibility quantification. We compare bare Cu and silver-coated Cu (Ag/Cu) WEs under varying current densities. At 0.25 mA cm-2(WE), both cells cycle reversibly. However, bare Cu shows edge-localized lithium deposition attributed to uneven interfacial contact, while Ag/Cu facilitates more uniform lithium spreading, but leads to a higher irreversible lithium amount and lower Coulombic efficiency. Above 0.5 mA cm-2(WE), both cells short-circuit. In Li|LPSC|Cu, failure initiates at the LPSC|Cu interface via spallation cracks. In Li|LPSC|Ag/Cu, Ag preserves interface integrity at the WE despite lithium initially plating at discrete nucleation spots. However, failure shifts to the Li|LPSC interface due to the non-uniform Li depletion at the CE exposes the underlying Cu, leading to spallation cracks upon subsequent plating. This finding underscores the critical role of the nanoscale nucleation layers in mitigating mechanical failure in ZE-ASSB and highlight interface engineering as a key strategy to address electro-chemo-mechanical degradation in LM and ZE ASSBs."

    "text": "Image-based modelling has emerged as a popular method within the field of lithium-ion battery modelling due to its ability to represent the heterogeneity of the porous electrodes. A common challenge from image-based modelling is the size of 3D tomography datasets, which can be of the order of several billion voxels. Previously, different approximation methods have been used to simplify the computational problem, but each of these come with associated limitations. Here we develop a data-driven, fully parallelisable, image-based modelling framework called OpenImpala. Micro X-ray computed tomography (CT) is used to obtain 3D microstructural data from samples non-destructively. These 3D datasets are then directly used as the computational domain for finite-differences based direct physical modelling (e.g. to solve the diffusion equation directly on the CT obtained datasets). OpenImpala then calculates the equivalent homogenised transport coefficients for the given microstructure. These coefficients are written into parameterised files for direct compatibility with two popular continuum battery models: PyBamm and DandeLiion, facilitating the link between different scales of computational battery modelling. OpenImpala has been shown to scale well with an increasing number of computational cores on distributed memory architectures, making it applicable to large datasets typical of modern tomography."
