### About This Site

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This repository contains all the source files used to build my personal website. The site is built using the excellent open-source publishing system, **[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)**.

The design and structure were inspired by the work of **[Silvia CanelÃ³n](https://silvia.rbind.io/)**.

### Philosophy

I believe in open science and reproducible work, which is why this repository is public. Feel free to explore the code to see how specific components are built, especially if you're learning Quarto. If you find it helpful for your own projects, that's fantastic! 

### Usage

While the underlying code is open for inspection, the written content, research, and overall design are personal to my work. Please use this repository for **inspiration**, but I ask that you do not duplicate the site verbatim. 

### Running Locally

To run a local version of this website for development or testing, you'll need to have [Quarto installed](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jameslehoux/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/jameslehoux/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Preview the site:**
    ```bash
    quarto preview
    ```

Quarto will start a local web server and open a preview of the site in your browser. The preview will automatically update whenever you save a change to a file.
