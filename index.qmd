::: {#hero-heading}

As a Faraday Institution/STFC **Emerging Leader Fellow** , I lead battery characterisation research across the UK's National Facilities. My work combines particle/matter experiments with **artificial intelligence** and modellling to create autonomous, high-throughput analysis pipelines that accelerate the discovery of next-generation **energy materials**.
